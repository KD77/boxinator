This is a small application for calculating the shipping cost for boxes to specific locations around the world. The aim of this application is to demonstrate how to implement a Full-stack application using REST API. It was designed using the MVC pattern and was tested by JUnit.In this project I used the following technology stack:

* Spring boot
* React Js
* Redux 
* MySQL
* CSS


## Configuration ##

### step 1 ###
* Clone or download the files.

### step 2 ###
* In the project directory of the client side you can run 
by using `npm install`

### step 3 ###
* To install all the dependencies run `npm start` 
* To view the application go to the browser and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### step 4 ###
* Backend source code: In spring boot, go to application.properties in the resource folder and change the database configuration.

````spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/{your database name}
spring.datasource.username={ username }
spring.datasource.password={ password }
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver)```
